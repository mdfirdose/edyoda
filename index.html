                        The last couple of years zekeLabs gave me a unique opportunity to assess technology demand in
                        the
                        industry and also to evaluate available talent pool for the demand.

                        Our consulting and technology training assignments for our corporate partners enlightened us on
                        the
                        technology skill in demand. We discovered - What, Where and which technologies are increasingly
                        being adopted by the Industry.</p>

                    <p>Ever since 2019, after a solid hit from the falling rate of economic growth, the job market seems
                        to
                        be
                        challenging. With the technology-enabled disruption continuing to play its part, companies are
                        becoming
                        far more discerning in terms of hiring. Their focus has now shifted towards making the best use
                        of
                        the
                        available human resources.</p>

                    <p>Soft skills are seen to be as important as your technical skill set. When an organisation is
                        hiring,
                        soft skills is given a lot of weightage and thus becomes a very important area for you as a
                        candidate to emphasize on.Typically, a job interview has got 2 broad rounds. One is the HR
                        round,
                        wherein a major selection is done, following which you have to get through the technical
                        interview
                        round, to ultimately get hired for an organisation.</p>
